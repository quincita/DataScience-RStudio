# Analysis
The regression data shows us the results of a linear regression analysis
The regression model used is trying to estimate the relationship between 
total UPDRS score (a measure of Parkinsons symptom severity) and 3 predictor 
variables (age, sex, and jitter %) with the Parkinsons data.  

The intercept coefficient of 4.84424 gives us the base estimated mean total UPDRS score.

The age coefficient of 0.36995 gives us the estimate increase in total UPDRS score as the patient 
ages annually provided that all other variables remain constant.

The sex coefficient of -2.01200 tells us that the estimated difference in total UPDRS between 
males and females (provided that all other variables are constant) shows that males have a lower 
estimated total UPDRS score than females. 

The jitter% coefficient of 136.43546 represents the estimated increase in total UPDRS score for a 
1 unit increase in jitter% provided that all other variables are constant.

The output of summary() gives us the information we need to draw some conclusions 
about the data.  The table identifies that the coefficients and the predictor variables. 
The coefficient for age is 0.36995, this means that as age increased annually by 1 unit 
the total UPDRS score is expected to increase by 0.36995 units provided that all other
variables are constant

The Signif codes column identifies if the variable is statistically significant.  
For our model all evaluated variables are statistically significant with regard to this data.

The Multiple Rsquared measures how well the data fits the model used. 
This model explains  (0.1084) 10.84% of the variation with regrard to total UPDRS score and 
how it is affected by age, sex, and jitter%.  The Adjusted 
R-squared is slightly lower (0.108) is similiar and accounts for the predictor variables.

The F statistic and pvalue tells the researcher if the model is statistically significant. 
In this instance the Fstatistic is 238 with 3 and 5871 degrees of freedom and tells us that all 
coefficients  are equal to zero except the intercept.  The small pvalue is less
than 2.2e-16, which tells us that this model is significant.  The p values associated with each 
coefficient provides evidence for the statistical significance of the predictor variables. 
All predictor variables in this model have pvalues that are less than 0.05.  This tells us that 
they are statistically significant in explaining the response variables.

## Research Question & Motivation
While the original research was meant to evaluate the relationship between the patient’s vocal patterns versus severity of Parkin’s symptoms,
I would like to see if we are able to use the data to predict the severity of Parkin’s Disease motor symptoms using the patient’s age, sex, and jitter_pct.   
This information could prepare and reassure the patient and their family on how the disease will progress as the patient ages. 

## Background on Data

This data set includes information on patients with Parkinson's disease. The data was compiled by Athanasios Tsanas and Max Little from the University of Oxford
in 2009, drawing on data from 10 different medical centers. Recordings of patients' voices were captured by a biomedical device placed in patients' homes. 
Voice recordings were then analyzed and attributes of their voice patterns quantified. The goal of the program was to provide data for clinicians to monitor 
the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms by tracking changes in their patients' voices over time.



## Description of Data & Descriptive Statistics
This dataset that was recorded in a csv file was gathered from 42 patients with Parkinson’s Disease, specifically the early stage of Parkinson’s.  
The patients participated in a six-month trial of the telemonitoring devices that recorded them throughout their daily comings and goings.  
The devices tracked and transmitted the patient data and sent the symptoms remotely to the researchers.  
The collected data was used to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores from each patient’s voice recording data.

Here are some key columns from the data set:

Columns in the data set were:
Subject number
Subject Age
Subject Gender
Time interval from base line recruitment date
Motor UPDRS
total UPDRS
16 biomedical voice measures


## Findings
This regression model helps us to understand how different factors affect Parkinsons Disease.  The model evaluates three factors (age, sex, and jitter (%).  
Based on the data that was examined, age and Jitter% have a positive effect on Parkinsons, meaning as the patient ages they aremore likely to develop the disease. 
The model also examined sex (male or female ).  This variable had a negative effect.  Upon further examination the data demonstrated 
that males are more likely to have develop Parkinsons.  This information can benefit researchers and physicians that are trying to understand, delay, 
treat, and or prevent the progression of the disease.
